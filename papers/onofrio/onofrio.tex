\section{Complexity-stability regimes}
\label{sec: complexity-stability regimes}
\textcolor{red}{Missing Intro and needs pruning.}

\subsection{$\alpha\beta\gamma$-model}

Consider a competitive community of $S$ species
defined by the following dynamics for the population abundances
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dx_i}{dt}=x_i^{\alpha}-x_i^{\beta}\sum_{j}A_{ij}x_j^{\gamma} \, ,
\end{equation}
where the sum runs from $j=1$ to $j=S$ and the off-diagonal elements
of $A$ are extracted from a distribution
with mean $\mu>0$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ while $A_{ii}=1/K^{\beta+\gamma-\alpha}$, $\forall i$,
and $K$ is the (uniform) carrying capacity.
If the equilibrium is feasible it formally reads
\begin{equation}
    (x_i^*)^{\alpha-\beta} = \sum_{j}A_{ij}(x_j^*)^{\gamma} \, .
\end{equation}
The element of the jacobian for $j\neq i$ read
\begin{equation}
    J_{ij} = -\gamma x_i^{\beta}A_{ij}x_j^{\gamma} \, ,
\end{equation}
while the diagonal components read
\begin{equation}
    J_{ii} = \alpha x_i^{\alpha-1}-\beta x_i^{\beta-1}\sum_{j\neq i}A_{ij}x_j^{\gamma}
    - (\beta+\gamma)A_{ii}x_i^{\beta+\gamma} \, .
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Uniform interaction limit}
In the case of uniform interactions ($\sigma\to0$)
the species population are all equal and the equilibrium reads
\begin{equation}
    x^*=\left[\mu(S-1)+\frac{1}{K^{\beta+\gamma-\alpha}}\right]^{1/(\alpha-\beta-\gamma)} \, .
\end{equation}
The jacobian evaluated at equilibrium is
\begin{equation}
    J_{ij}\Big{|}_{x=x^*} = -\gamma \mu (x^*)^{\beta+\gamma-1} \, ,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    J_{ii}\Big{|}_{x=x^*} = \alpha (x^*)^{\alpha-1}-\beta (x^*)^{\beta+\gamma-1}\mu(S-1)
                            -\frac{(\beta+\gamma)}{K^{\beta+\gamma-\alpha}}(x^*)^{\beta+\gamma-1}\, .
\end{equation}

The maximum eigenvalue $\lambda_{\textrm{max}}$ is $S-1$ degenerate and reads formally
\begin{equation}
    \lambda_{\textrm{max}} = J_{ii}\Big{|}_{x=x^*} - J_{ij}\Big{|}_{x=x^*} \, .
\end{equation}
The stability condition
\begin{equation}
    \lambda_{\textrm{max}} = \alpha (x^*)^{\alpha-1}-(x^*)^{\beta+\gamma-1}\left[\beta \mu(S-1)
    +\frac{(\beta+\gamma)}{K^{\beta+\gamma-\alpha}}-\gamma\mu\right]<0 \, ,
\end{equation}
can be written as
\begin{equation}
    \alpha (x^*)^{\alpha-\beta-\gamma}-\left[\beta \mu(S-1)
    +\frac{(\beta+\gamma)}{K^{\beta+\gamma-\alpha}}-\gamma\mu\right]<0 \, ,
\end{equation}
which, using the expression for $x^*$ and after some manipulations reads
\begin{equation}
    (S-1)(\beta-\alpha) > \frac{K^{\beta+\gamma-\alpha}\mu\gamma+\alpha-\beta-\gamma}{K^{\beta+\gamma-\alpha}\mu} \, .
\end{equation}
We have then three possibilities:
\begin{align}
    S &> 1 + \frac{K^{\beta+\gamma-\alpha}\mu\gamma+\alpha-\beta-\gamma}{K^{\beta+\gamma-\alpha}\mu(\beta-\alpha)} 
    &\textrm{if} \quad \alpha<\beta \, , \\
    S &< 1 + \frac{K^{\beta+\gamma-\alpha}\mu\gamma+\alpha-\beta-\gamma}{K^{\beta+\gamma-\alpha}\mu(\beta-\alpha)} 
    &\textrm{if} \quad \alpha>\beta \, , \\
    \mu &< \frac{1}{K^{\gamma}} &\textrm{if} \quad \alpha=\beta \, .
\end{align}
A series of comments is in order. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Depending on $\alpha$ and $\beta$ we have \textit{two
    regimes}: one in which increasing $S$ enhances stability ($\alpha<\beta$) and 
    one in which it hinders stability ($\alpha>\beta$).
    Notably this is independent from $\gamma$, indicating that only the interplay between
    the density dependence of the contribution of a species to the interactions and
    the density dependence of its production term that is (qualitatively) relevant; 
    and not the form of the contribution of the competitors to the interactions.
    \item The critical case ($\alpha=\beta$) recovers the usual GLV result
    for $\gamma=1$ and generalizes it for generic $\gamma$.
    \item For $K\to\infty$ and $\beta=1=\gamma$ we obtain
    \begin{equation}
        S=1+\frac{1}{1-\alpha} \, .
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}
For symmetry reasons, it is probably sensible to consider 
models with $\gamma=\beta$,
leaving the potential asymmetry of the competitive interaction between two species
to the coefficient $A_{ij}$.

One can therefore identify two different regimes (complexity hinders stability (May) and 
complexity increases stability)
characterized by the dynamical response of the population with respect to their density
encoded in the exponents $\alpha$ and $\beta$, resepctively associated
to production and losses. The GLV case $\alpha=\beta$ is right in the middle for uniform
interactions ($\sigma\to0$) and falls into the May regime otherwise ($\sigma\neq0$). 

\subsection{Generalized Lotka-Volterra with generic production}
\textcolor{red}{Maybe take out.}

Consider a competitive community of $S$ species
defined by the following dynamics for the population abundances
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dx_i}{dt}=g(x_i)-x_i\sum_{j\neq i}A_{ij}x_j \, ,
\end{equation}
where the $A_{ij}$ are extracted from a distribution
with mean $\mu>0$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ and
the production term $g_i(x_i)$ may in principle include
self-regulation terms which are only dependent on species $i$
and parameters typical of species $i$.

If the equilibrium is feasible, denoting $x_i^*$ the equilibrium values,
we have
\begin{equation}
    g_i(x_i^*)=x_i^*\sum_{j\neq i}A_{ij}x_j^* \, .
\end{equation}
The jacobian evaluated at equilibrium is formally
\begin{equation}
    J_{ij}\Big{|}_{\bf{x}=\bf{x}^*} = -x_i^*A_{ij} \, ,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    J_{ii}\Big{|}_{\bf{x}=\bf{x}^*} =  g_i'(x_i^*)-\frac{g_i(x_i^*)}{x_i^*}\, ,
\end{equation}
where $g_i'(x_i^*)$ stands for $|d g_i(x_i)/d x_i|_{x_i=x_i^*}$ 
and we used the equilibrium relation.

In order to make some analytical progress let us focus on the case
of uniform interactions ($\sigma\to0$) and production
with same parameters for every species, i.e. $g_i=g$ $\forall i$.
Then every species have the same equilibrium value $x_i^*=x^*$
$\forall i$ and we can write down the equilibrium relation
\begin{equation}
    g(x^*)=(S-1)\mu (x^*)^2 \, ,
\end{equation}
and the jacobian at equilibrium
\begin{equation}
    J_{ij}\Big{|}_{x=x^*} = -x^*\mu \, ,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    J_{ii}\Big{|}_{x=x^*} =  g'(x^*)-\frac{g(x^*)}{x^*}\, .
\end{equation}
The largest eigenvalue correspond to
\begin{equation}
    \lambda_{\max}=J_{ii}\Big{|}_{x=x^*}-J_{ij}\Big{|}_{x=x^*} \, ,
\end{equation}
therefore the stability condition reads
\begin{equation}
    g'(x^*)- \frac{g(x^*)}{x^*} + x^*\mu < 0 \, .
\end{equation}
By exploiting the equilibrium relation we can recast the last
inequality as
\begin{equation}
    g'(x^*)- \frac{g(x^*)}{x^*} + \frac{g(x^*)}{x^*(S-1)} < 0 \, ,
\end{equation}
therefore giving the general formal stability condition in terms
of production at equilibrium and equilibrium density
\begin{equation}
    g'(x^*) < \frac{g(x^*)}{x^*}\left(1 - \frac{1}{S-1}\right) \, ,
\end{equation}
which for $S\to\infty$ can be approximated by 
\begin{equation}
    g'(x^*) < \frac{g(x^*)}{x^*} \, .
\end{equation}
This last stability condition is quite general and, exploiting the trivial identity
$1=dx/dx|_{x=x^*}=:(x^*)'$, it can be written as
\begin{equation}
    \frac{g'(x^*)}{g(x^*)} < \frac{(x^*)'}{x^*}\, ,
\end{equation}
which means that the relative change in growth should be less than the relative
change in abundance itself.

Logistic and sublinear cases are recovered by substitutig resepctively
$g(x)=x(1-x/K)$ and $g(x)=x^k$.

\section{On sublinear production}
\label{sec: On sublinear production}
Observations point towards a sublinear production scaling
with respect to the population biomass density. 
This observations may refer to
dynamical production or to the equilibrium production observed
across a biomass gradient.

In this section we discuss how dynamical sublinear production does not generally leads to 
sublinear production across a biomass gradient.
Nonetheless, although not sufficient, it might be necessary for
sublinear scaling across a biomass gradient.

\subsection{Single population}
Let us focus on a single population example to calrify the ideas.
Consider a production function of the form
\begin{equation}
    g(x) = r x^\alpha \, ,
\label{eq: production}
\end{equation}
where $x$ is the abundance of the population, $\alpha\leq1$
specify the intensity of sublinear dynamical scaling (linear when $\alpha=1$) 
and $r$ is the parameter that allows to move across a gradient.
Consider then a loss term of the form
\begin{equation}
    l(x) = z x^\beta \, .
\end{equation} 
The evolution equaiton for the population is 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dx}{dt} = g(x) - l(x) = r x^\alpha - z x^\beta \, ,
    \label{eq: single}
\end{equation} 
which reduces to logistic growth for $\alpha=1$ and $\beta=2$.
The equilibrium is given by
\begin{equation}
    x^* = \left(\frac{r}{z}\right)^{1/(\beta-\alpha)} \, ,
\label{eq: equilibrium single}
\end{equation}
and the stability condition is given by
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d\left[g(x)-l(x)\right]}{dx}\bigg|_{x=x^*} < 0 \, ,
\end{equation}
which leads, after some calculations, to the condition
\begin{equation}
    \alpha<\beta \, ,
\end{equation}
independent from $r$ and $z$.

The equilibrium production scales, at varying growth rate $r$,
as $g(x^*)=z(x^*)^\beta$ as can be noted by Eq.~(\ref{eq: equilibrium single})
for $r$ and then substituting it in the defining Eq.~(\ref{eq: production})
or simply by considering the dynamical equation at stationarity.
Notice that, if $z$ is varied instead, the exponent
of dynamical and across-gradient production coincide.

In summary, for an environmental change that amount to a change in $r$, 
the production across a gradient 
scales as $(x^*)^\beta$. In order for
the stationary solution to be stable an exponent $\alpha<\beta$
for the dynamical produciton is needed.
Therefore, in order to have sublinear $g(x^*)$ across a gradient,
we need $\alpha<\beta<1$.
If the increment of the equilibrium density is due to decreasing $x$,
equilibrium and dynamical production scale in the same way and in order to
have sublinear $g(x^*)$ we need $\alpha<1$ with $\alpha<\beta$ for stability
but no constraint on $\beta$. Either way we need $\alpha<1$.

\textcolor{red}{Maybe add generalization to community through DMFT?}

\section{Cavity solution for sublinear growth}
\label{sec: cavity solution}
In this section we derive the cavity solution which is used in the main text.

Let us consider the dynamics of the population abundances $x_i$ for $S$ species
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d x_i}{dt} = r_ix_i^k - x_i\sum_{j\neq i}A_{ij}x_j \, ,
    \label{eq: full system}
\end{equation}
where the entries of the interaction matrix $A_{ij}$ 
and are randomly distributed with average $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$
and the $r_i$ are growth rates extracted from a distribution $P(r)$. 

\textcolor{red}{Cavity trick description ... 
(Refs.~\cite{Bunin2017,Barbier18,Barbier17,Advani2018,Cui2020})}


The cavity solution is the random variable $x^*$ given by
\begin{equation}
    x^* = \left(\frac{\mu S \langle x^* \rangle + \sigma \sqrt{S\langle (x^*)^2\rangle} \eta}
    {r}\right)^{1/(k-1)} \, ,
    \label{eq: cavity solution}
\end{equation}
where $\langle x^*\rangle$ and $\langle (x^*)^2\rangle$ are 
the first two moments of the equilibrium average biomass density
and $\eta$ is a standard normal random variable, i.e. $P(\eta)=\mathcal N (0,1)$.
The equilibrium probability distribution function for $x^*$, $P(x^*)$,
can be obtained through the pushforward of the distribution of $\eta$ and $r$
\textcolor{red}{add details of derivation}
\begin{equation}
    P(x^*)=\frac{(1-k)|x^*|^{k-2}}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2 S\langle (x^*)^2 \rangle}}
    \int_0^{\infty}dr \ r P(r)
    \exp{\left\{-\frac{\left[(x^*)^{k-1}-\mu S\langle x^*\rangle/r\right]^2}{2\sigma^2S\langle (x^*)^2 \rangle/r^2}\right\}} \, ,
\end{equation}
where the fraction of survival species $\phi$ and the first two moment
have to be self-consistently computed
\begin{align}
    \phi&= \int_0^{\infty}dx^* \ P(x^*)\, , \nonumber \\
    \langle x^*\rangle&=\frac{1}{\phi}\int_0^{\infty}dx^* \ x^*P(x^*) \, , \label{eq: self-consistenty}\\
    \langle (x^*)^2\rangle&=\frac{1}{\phi}\int_0^{\infty}dx^* \ (x^*)^2 P(x^*) \, . \nonumber
\end{align}

In the case of a unique $r$ for every species in the community, i.e. $P(\bar{r})=\delta(r-\bar{r})$
the distribution reads
\begin{equation}
    P(x^*)=\frac{(1-k)|x^*|^{k-2}}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2 S\langle (x^*)^2 \rangle/r^2}}
    \exp{\left\{-\frac{\left[(x^*)^{k-1}-\mu S\langle x^*\rangle/r\right]^2}{2\sigma^2S\langle (x^*)^2 \rangle/r^2}\right\}} \, .
    \label{eq: species dist unique r}
\end{equation}
We can't formally solve the self-consistent equations~(\ref{eq: self-consistenty})
because the first and second moment of  for this distribution diverges.
A similiar problem is encountered in Ref.~\cite{Cui2020}
in the context of consumer-resource models for the cavity calculations of
the distribution of the resources which is, \textit{mutatis mutandis}, 
equivalent of our case for $k=2$. (\textcolor{red}{We should take into account that
the cavity solution is an idealization of the initial problem and 
this kind of pathologies are not necessarely realistic.
For example extreme value theory~\cite{Majumdar2020} predicts that on average the largest
value observed in a system of
size $S$ scales like $S$ itself. On the other hand the distribution as $S$ increases
becomes closer to a gaussian and eventually all the heterogeneity disappears
because of the size dependence of the term multiplying $\eta$ is quadratic while the
one multuplying $\mu$ is linear and dominates for very large $S$.})

\textcolor{red}{Refine or remove these explanations.}

Assuming that the fluctuations in the numerator in Eq.~(\ref{eq: cavity solution})
are small, i.e. $\sigma \sqrt{S\langle (x^*)^2\rangle}\ll \mu S \langle x^* \rangle$,
we can Taylor expand to the first-order the cavity solution obtaining
\begin{equation}
    x^* = \left(\frac{ \mu S \langle x^* \rangle}{r}\right)^{1/(k-1)} +
    \frac{1}{k-1}\left(\frac{ \mu S \langle x^* \rangle}{r}\right)^{(2-k)/(k-1)}\sigma \sqrt{S\langle (x^*)^2\rangle}\eta \, ,
\end{equation}
which is a gaussian variable, truncated in 0 to respect
non-negativity constraint, with mean
\begin{equation}
    \langle x^* \rangle = \left(\frac{ \mu S \langle x^* \rangle}{r}\right)^{1/(k-1)} \, ,
\end{equation}
and standard deviation
\begin{equation}
    \sqrt{\langle (x^*)^2 \rangle - \langle x^* \rangle^2} =
    \frac{1}{k-1}\left(\frac{ \mu S \langle x^* \rangle}{r}\right)^{(2-k)/(k-1)}\sigma \sqrt{S\langle (x^*)^2\rangle} \, .
\end{equation}

In this approximation we can solve analytically 
the self consistency equations for the first to moment of the
distribution as functions of the parameters, namely 
\begin{equation}
    \langle x^* \rangle = \left(\frac{ \mu S}{r}\right)^{1/(k-2)} \, ,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    \langle (x^*)^2 \rangle = \frac{ \langle x^* \rangle^2}
    {\left[1-\left(\frac{1}{k-1}\right)^2\langle x^* \rangle^{2(2-k)}
    \sigma^2S\right]} \, .
\end{equation}

We can now either use directly the gaussian approximation to describe the
species distribution or alternative use the moment evaluated by means
of the gaussian approximation in expression 

For practical purposes
we can also solve numerically the self-consistent
equations~(\ref{eq: self-consistenty}) using a large
upper cut off $x_{\textrm{up}}$ which we checked can be widely varied
and gives consistent results.
In Fig.~\ref{fig: SM cavity + mixed + gauss} we report comparisons
of the cavity solution~(\ref{eq: species dist unique r}) 
obtained solving numerically the self-consistent equations,
the one with the moment injected from the gaussian calulation and the
approximated gaussian solution.

    $\sigma=\mu/20$ (center) and $\sigma=\mu/100$ (right).}
    \label{fig: SM cavity + mixed + gauss}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Dynamical mean field theory}
In order to obtain information about the dynamics
of the distributions of the biomass densities of the community,
following, e.g., Ref.~\cite{Roy2019} we can derive
from Eq.~(\ref{eq: full system}), for large $S$, 
a dynamical mean field theory which provide us a stochastic differential
equation describing statistically the entire ensemble of species
thorug the evolution of the representtive random variable $x$
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d x}{dt} = rx^k -
     x\left(\mu S \langle x \rangle_t + \sigma \sqrt{S} \eta_t \right)\, ,
\label{eq: dmft}
\end{equation}
where $\langle x\rangle_t=\langle x(t)\rangle$ is the average at time $t$ of the random variable
$b$ and $\eta$ is a gaussian variable
with zero mean and correlation given by $\langle x(t)x(s)\rangle$; these first and
second moment have to be computed self-consistently at each time. 
At equilibrium the cavity solution is recovered.

From Eq.~(\ref{eq: dmft}) is possible to connect the arguments about
sublinear growth for the one dimensional model in 
Section~\ref{sec: On sublinear production}
to a competitive community.

\textcolor{red}{Figure out if leave or not this subsection.}


\section{Boundary of stable phase in $(\mu, \sigma)$ plane}
\textcolor{red}{double-check a la Stone 
derivation of the results and finish derivation for the
calculation of the critical line.}

In this section we combine the results from Ahmadian \emph{et al.}~\cite{Ahmadian2015} 
on the distribution of eigenvalues
in the complex plane with the cavity solution derived in 
Section~\ref{sec: cavity solution} to obtain a line in the $(\mu, \sigma)$
plane separating a stable and an unstbale phase.

In Ref.~\cite{Ahmadian2015} is shown that the spectrum of matrices of the form 
$M + LJR$, where $M$,  $L$ and $R$ are $S\times S$ deterministic matrices and $J$ 
is a $S\times S$ random matrix whose coefficients have mean zero and variance $\sigma^2$ 
is contained in the region of the complex plane 
\begin{equation}
    \textrm{Tr}[(M_zM_z^\dagger)^{-1}]\geq 1/\sigma^2 \quad \textrm{where}\ M_z = L^{-1}(zI - M)R^{-1}, 
\end{equation}
where $\textrm{Tr}$ denotes the trace of the matrix. In the special case where 
$L$, $R$ and $M$ are diagonal, this condition reads
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{i=1}^S\frac{(L_{i}R_{i})^2}{ \vert z - M_{i}\vert^2 }\geq 1/\sigma^2.
\end{equation}

Consider the system of $S$ species defined by
\begin{equation}
    \frac{dx_i}{dt} = x_ig(x_i) - x_i\sum_{j\neq i}A_{ij}x_j \, ,
\end{equation}
where the $g(x_i)$ is the per capita growth rate and $A$ is a matrix with
zero diagonal and off-diagonal elements
ditrubuted with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$.

We can apply this result to estimate the location of the eigenvalues 
of the community matrix $C$, defined as the jacobian of the system
evaluate equilibrium point $\bf{x}^*$.
The off diagonal elements of the jacobian at equilibrium are
\begin{equation}
    J_{ij}\Big{|}_{\bf{x}=\bf{x}^*} = -x_i^*A_{ij} \, ,
\end{equation}
while the diagonal reads
\begin{equation}
    J_{ii}\Big{|}_{\bf{x}=\bf{x}^*} = -\sum_{j\neq i}A_{ij}x_j^* + g(x_i^*)-x_i^*g'(x_i^*) 
    = -x_i^*g'(x_i^*) \, ,
\end{equation}
where for the last equality we used the equilibrium relation and $g'(x_i^*):=d g(x_i)/dx_i|_{x_i=x_i^*}$.
The community matrix therefore reads
\begin{equation}
    C = -D(\mathbf x^*)A - D(\mathbf x^*g'(\mathbf x^*)) \, ,
\end{equation}
where we denote $D(\bf{y}):=\textrm{diag}(\bf{y})$ stands for a diagonal matrix
filled with the components of the vector $\bf{y}$.
Writing $A = \mu \mathbf{1} - \mu I + J$, and identifying 
$L = -D(\mathbf x^*)$, $R = I$ and $M = \mu I -  D(\mathbf x^*g'(\mathbf x^*))$
we can say that the eigenvalues lie within the domain
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i} \frac{(x_i^*)^2}{\vert z -\mu + x_i^*g'(x_i^*)\vert ^2}\geq 1/\sigma^2. 
\end{equation} 
This domain touches $z = 0$ (triggering an instability) whenever
\begin{equation}
    \sum_i \frac{1}{|\mu -P(n_i^*)/(n_i^*)^2+P'(n_i^*)/n_i^*|^2}\geq 1/\sigma^2 \, .
\end{equation}

\section{Model connection with data on productivity}
Our model is informed by macroecological observations
of biomass density production across major groups.
In this section we attempt a closer connection to the data.

We define our model in the following way
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d b_i}{dt} = \underbrace{r_ib_i\left(\frac{b_i}{b_0}\right)^{k -1}\theta(b_i-b_0)}_\text{Production}
     - \underbrace{b_i\sum_{j\neq i}A_{ij}b_j}_\text{Losses} \, ,
\end{equation}
where $k<1$
specify the intensity of sublinear dynamical scaling,
the entries of the interaction matrix $A_{ij}$
are randomly distributed with average $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$,
the $r_i$ are growth rates extracted from a distribution
$P(r)$, the biomass density scale
$b_0$.
For the sake of clarity let us summarize the dimensionality of
the several terms involved in the model
\begin{equation}
    [b_i] = [b_0] =  \frac{\textrm{mass}}{\textrm{area}} \ ,
    \quad [r_i]=\frac{1}{\textrm{time}} \ , 
    \quad [A_{ij}]=\frac{\textrm{area}}{\textrm{mass}\times \textrm{time}} \ .
\end{equation}
The density biomass scale $b_0$ set the value at which the per capita
growth rate is $r_i$. When we want to consider this value the
maximum per capita growth rate for a given species we can
consider $b_0$ as the minimal biomass density for a given species
at which it is able to reproduce. 
In this case we can impose that there is no growth
for $b_i<b_0$ through a Heaviside function $\theta(b_i-b_0)$.

Next we connect the model with the average body mass $m$ of a community. 
The time scale of the problem are widely observed~\cite{Hatton2019}
to scale with the body mass with an exponent $-1/4$.
Therefore we assume that the average growth rate $\langle r \rangle$ for
a community and the average interaction $\mu$ scale with the average body mass
of the community to the $-1/4$, 
i.e. $\langle r\rangle\sim m^{-1/4}$ and $\langle \mu \rangle\sim m^{-1/4}$.
We have no reasons to assume a systematic variation of the ratio
$\mu/\sigma$ with respect to the mass.
We assume for simplicity that $b_0$ is species and mass independent. 
We may invoke an ecological argument
to justify this assumption, 
indeed the observed biomass densities across major group
have a mass independent lower bound (within two or three order of magnitude compared
with the astronomical difference of nearly 20 order of magnitude in body mass).
The population density scale for a given community of average mass
$m$, $n_0:=(b_0)/m$, is then assumed to be inversely proportional to the mass.

To compare this data with outcomes of the model
we proceede as follows. We characterize a community type
by an average mass, and therefore by an average growth rate $\langle r\rangle$,
then we solve the model for different communities with same average $r$ but
different $\mu$ and plot the resulting $\langle b^* \ g(b^*)\rangle$ vs 
$\langle b^*\rangle$. In this process we keep the coefficient 
of variation $\sigma/\mu$ constant.
We keep $S$ constant and vary $\mu$ in a range which scales
with $m$ in the same way that the average $r$ does across community type:
within a community type we plot results for communities with 
$\mu S\in(\langle r\rangle\mu_{\min}, \langle r\rangle\mu_{\max})$, with $\mu_{\min}$
and $\mu_{\max}$ possibly mass dependent but with $\mu_{\min}<1$ and $\mu_{\max}>1$.
In other words, in order to not introduce strong  biases towards specific
masses, within community type and for every community type,
we simulate different environment 
going from a $\mu$ which is 
less than $\langle r\rangle$ to one which is more than $\langle r\rangle$.
We can summarize the assumptions in the following way.
\\

\textbf{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $b_0$ is body mass independent
          and $n_0$ for a community is inversely proportional to the average
          body mass $m$ of the community.
    \item $ r \sim m^{-1/4}$ and characterize the typical growth rate
          of a community type with the typical body mass $m$.
    \item $\mu\sim m^{-1/4}$ for a given community type of average mass $m$.
    \item To explore ecological variation among communities
          of the same type we cosider different 
          $\mu S\in(r\mu_{\min}, r\mu_{\max})$
          with $\mu_{\min}<1$ and $\mu_{\max}>1$.
    \item the coefficient of variation $\mu/\sigma$ does not vary systematically
          both within and across community type.
    \item $k<1$, in particular, in orderd to closely recover the observed pattern, $k\simeq3/4$
\end{itemize}
Each point in Fig.~\ref{fig: SM production} 
correspond
to an entire community, with on the $x$ axis the average biomass
of the community $\langle b^* \rangle$ and on the $y$ axis the
average equilibrium production of the community 
$\langle b^* \ g(b^*)\rangle$. Within each community type the points follow
a scaling law with exponent aroun $3/4$.

\subsection{Analytical prediction of average equilibrium production}
In order to compute how the average production changes with respect to 
the average biomass density in our context we can resosrt to the cavity
solution computed in the previous section which \textit{mutatis mutandis}
in terms of biomass density reads
\begin{equation}
    b^* = \left(\frac{\mu S \langle b^* \rangle + \sigma \sqrt{S\langle (b^*)^2\rangle} \eta}
    {r \ b_0^{1-k}}\right)^{1/(k-1)} \, .
    \label{eq: cavity solution biomass}
\end{equation}
At equilibrium we have
\begin{equation}
    b^*g(b^*)\equiv\underbrace{rb^*\left(\frac{b^*}{b_0}\right)^{k -1}}_\text{Production}
    = \underbrace{b^*(\mu S \langle b^* \rangle + \sigma \sqrt{S\langle (b^*)^2\rangle} \eta)}_\text{Losses} \, ,
\end{equation}
therefore
\begin{equation}
    \langle b^*g(b^*)\rangle =  \mu S \langle b^* \rangle^2 + 
    \sigma \sqrt{S\langle (b^*)^2\rangle} \langle b^*\eta\rangle \, .
    \label{eq: formal for production}
\end{equation}
Invoking the gaussian approximation we know that the average reads
\begin{equation}
    \langle b^*\rangle = \left(\frac{\mu S}{r \ b_0^{1-k}}\right)^{1/(k-2)} \, ,
\end{equation}
which, if inverted for $\mu S$, gives
\begin{equation}
    \mu S = r \ b_0^{1-k} \langle b^*\rangle^{k-2} \, ,
\end{equation}
which imply that the first term on the r.h.s. of Eq.~(\ref{eq: formal for production}) is
equal to $r \ b_0^{1-k}\langle b^* \rangle^k$.

The second term is more involved. By writing explicitely the expression for
$b^*$ it reads
\begin{align}
    \sigma \sqrt{S\langle (b^*)^2\rangle} \langle b^*\eta\rangle &= 
    \sigma \sqrt{S\langle (b^*)^2\rangle}
    \left\langle  \left(\frac{\mu S \langle b^* \rangle + \sigma \sqrt{S\langle (b^*)^2\rangle} \eta}
    {r \ b_0^{1-k}}\right)^{1/(k-1)} \eta\right\rangle \nonumber \, ,\\
    &= \sigma \sqrt{S\langle (b^*)^2\rangle} r^{1/(1-k)}b_0
    \left\langle  \frac{\eta}{(\mu S \langle b^* \rangle + 
    \sigma \sqrt{S\langle (b^*)^2\rangle} \eta)^{1/(1-k)}}\right\rangle \, .
\end{align}
The leading term in the denominator for large $S$ is
$(\mu S \langle b^* \rangle)^{1/(1-k)}$, which for $k=3/4$ is proportional
to $S^4$, while the others have a lower order dependence on $S$. Therefore
if we approximate the whole denominator by $(\mu S \langle b^* \rangle)^{1/(1-k)}$ 
and recall that $\langle \eta \rangle=0$ we can neglect this term
and approximate the average production as
\begin{equation}
    \langle b^*g(b^*)\rangle \simeq r \ b_0^{1-k}\langle b^*\rangle^k \, .
\end{equation}

\subsection{Note on the origin of sublinear growth}

Mechanistic justifications of the emergence
of sublinear dynamical growth at the coarse level of description
of the model studied in this work should be
sought after. However our results suggest
that mechanistic descriptions of community dynamics 
leading to an effective sublinear growth 
(or, more generally, to a relative change 
of production with respect of population abundance
lower than the relative change of losses,
see Sec.~\ref{sec: complexity-stability regimes})
will be qualitatively characterized by a positive
correlation beteween stability and complexity.

The macroecological data which inspired the model studied in this work
have mixed origin, some can be directely connected with
dynamical production and other are cross-ecosystem patterns.
More precise and systematic observations of the former 
and validation of the latter at the ecosystem level
with temporal data are needed 
(see Ref.~\cite{Barbier2021} for an example of a macroecologially motivated
model and subsequent discussion about within ecosystem validation).
\\\\

\textbf{Among the task that future theoretical work should aim at, we suggest}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Building a mechanistic understanding of the emergence
          of sublinear dynamical scaling from realistic models.
    \item Connecting the abundance prediction from community
          models with macroecological patterns related to abundance.
          In particular when we go from within community description
          to cross-community.
    \item Exploring in detail possibilities different from 
          sublinear dynamical scaling to explain cross-ecosystem 
          sublinear scaling and test indipendent predicrtions.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Future urgent experimental and field research include}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Collecting temporal data within ecosystems and devise ways 
          to estimate the population abundance or density dependence
          on production.
    \item Extending the spectrum of data available in order to 
          further validate the evidence of sublinear production.
\end{itemize} 

\section{Macroecological laws}
In this section we compare macroecological patterns
with prediction of our model specifying in which way
we construct the observable to compare and under which assumptions
in addtion to the ones described in the construction of the model.

\subsection{Species abundance distribution}
The species abundance distribution distribution within a community
is often well fitted by a log-normal distribution.
In order to recover this pattern for the abundance density $n_i$ 
with our model we assume that
the growth rates $r_i$ follows a log-normal distribution.
\\

\textbf{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\ln r\sim\mathcal{N} (\mu_r,\sigma_r)$.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Predictions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We predict that $n^*$ roughly follows a 
    log-normal distribution as well and, if we consider $k=3/4$,
    it has shape parameter 4 times larger than the one for $r$.
\end{itemize}

We can work out an exact calculation in the case of uniform interactions (i.e. $\sigma\to0$),
which works well also for small but finite $\sigma$.
In this case the cavity solution for $n^*$ (Eq.~(\ref{eq: cavity solution})) reads
\begin{equation}
    n^* = \left(\frac{\mu S \langle n^* \rangle}
    {r \ n_0^{1-k}}\right)^{1/(k-1)} \, ,
\end{equation}
where we recall that consider for simplicity that the scale $n_0$ is the same for all the species in
the community and set it to unity, $n_0=1$, in the following.

We can obtain the probability distribution for $n^*$ by pushing forward the one for $r$,
$P(n^*)=P(r(n^*))|dr/dn^*|$. Given that $r(n^*)$ reads
\begin{equation}
    r=\frac{(n^*)^{k-1}}{\mu S \langle n^* \rangle} \, ,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
    \left|\frac{dr}{dn^*}\right| = \frac{(1-k)(n^*)^{k-2}}{\mu S \langle n^* \rangle} \, ,
\end{equation}
we obtain that $n^*$ is as well a log-normal random variable
\begin{equation}
    \ln n^*\sim\mathcal N (\mu_{n^*}, \sigma_{n^*}) \, ,
    \label{eq: cavity for lognormal r}
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{align}
    \mu_{n^*} &= \frac{\mu_r - \ln{(\mu S \langle n^* \rangle)}}{(1-k)} \, , \\
    \sigma_{n^*} &= \frac{\sigma_r}{(1-k)} \, .
\end{align}
Notice that the scale parameter is amplified by a factor $1/(1-k)$, which in the
case of $k\simeq3/4$ correspond to a species abundance distribution four times
wider than the growth rate distribution.

In this case we only need to solve a self-consistent equation 
for the average $\langle n^* \rangle$ to complete the cavity solution.
This can be done analytically because the expression of the average
for a log-normal distribution is known
\begin{equation}
    \langle n^* \rangle = \exp{\left(\mu_{n^*}+\frac{\sigma_{n^*}^2}{2}\right)} \, ,
\end{equation}
and we have
\begin{equation}
    \langle n^* \rangle = (\mu S)^{(k-2)}
    \exp{\left[\frac{2\mu_r(1-k)+\sigma_r^2}{2(1-k)(2-k)}\right]} \, .
\end{equation}

In Fig.~\ref{fig: SM species abundance lognormal} the cavity results are compared with simulations showing
perfect agreement in the case $\sigma\to0$ (left panel)
and good agreement also in the case of finite $\sigma$ (right panel).

\begin{figure}[h!]

    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{fig/SM-species-abd.pdf}
    \caption{Cavity solution compared to simulations for log-normal distribution of growth rates $r$,

    and a pool of $S=500$ species with $\mu=10^{-3}$, $k=3/4$ and $\sigma\to0$ (left panel)
    while $\sigma=0.7\mu$ (right panel).}
    \label{fig: SM species abundance lognormal}
\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{fig: SM species abundance realistic} we report the abundance distributions
for the four community types as parametrized in the model construction (details in caption).

    we set $\mu S = \langle r \rangle $ and $\sigma/\mu=0.7 $ and $r$
    is lognormally distributed with mode chose as 
    $\exp(\mu_r)=\langle r \rangle B_0^{1-k}$ specific for each color
    as per model construction and shape parameter $\sigma_r = 0.16$
    for red, 0.38 for blue, 0.54 for light blue and 0.34 for yellow.

    in Eq.~(\ref{eq: cavity for lognormal r}) 
    which well compare with simulations.}
    \label{fig: SM species abundance realistic}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Mean-variance scaling}
The variance of fluctuations in biomass densities for time series
of different species scale with mean biomass density with an exponent
from $3/2$ to 2.
We consider again a log-normal distribution for $r$
and that the loss term of our model exhibits variation in mortality
(e.g. $\mu$ varies).
\\

\textbf{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\ln r\sim\mathcal{N} (\mu_r,\sigma_r)$ (only needed for analytical results).
    \item $\mu$ varies (in the case of uniform $r$, the ratio $\mu/\sigma$ should be constant).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Predictions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Taylor's law.
\end{itemize}

We consider again the cavity result in the limit $\sigma\to0$
which, in the case of $\ln r\sim \mathcal N (\mu_r, \sigma_r)$,
gives $\ln b^*\sim\mathcal N (\mu_{b^*}, \sigma_{b^*})$ with
\begin{align}
    \mu_{b^*} &= \frac{\mu_r-\ln{(\mu S \langle b^* \rangle)}}{(1-k)} \, , \\
    \sigma_{b^*} &= \frac{\sigma_r}{(1-k)} \, .
\end{align}
By varying $\mu$ only the scale parameter $\mu_{b^*}$ is modified.
Therefore if we consider the mean and variace of the log-normal distribution
\begin{align}
    \langle b^* \rangle &= \exp{\left(\mu_{b^*}+\frac{\sigma_{b^*}^2}{2}\right)} \, , \\
    \textrm{var}(b^*)&=  
    \left(\exp[\sigma_{b^*}^2]-1\right)\exp{\left(2\mu_{b^*}+\sigma_{b^*}^2\right)}\, , \\
\end{align}
it is straightforward to realize that the mean is proportional to $\exp(\mu_{b^*})$, while
the variance to $\exp(2\mu_{b^*})$, therefore
\begin{equation}
    \textrm{var}(b^*) \propto  \langle b^* \rangle^2 \, ,
\end{equation}
i.e., Taylor's law.
In Fig.~\ref{fig: SM Taylor's law} we report a comparison 
with simulations with lognormally distributed $r$ and $\sigma\to0$, 
lognormally distribute $r$ and finite $\sigma=\mu/10$, to show
that the results hold in this case, and, even if in this case we don't have analytical results 
(\textcolor{red}{I manage to obtain one, to be added}),
also with uniform $r=1$ and 
finite $\sigma=\mu/10$.

\end{figure}

In Fig.~\ref{fig: SM Taylor's law realistic} we report variance vs.
average for the communitites parametrized as in model construction (Fig.~\ref{fig: SM production}),
finding a good agreement with Taylor's law, see caption for details.

    caption of Fig.~\ref{fig: SM production}).}
    \label{fig: SM Taylor's law realistic}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Size-density scaling}
The species-level relation of population density vs. body mass
is nearly inversely proportional across major groups.
By relying on no further assumptions then in those used
to connect the model with data on production we predict
a size-density scaling with exponent -1.

\textbf{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Same as for the connection of the model with data on production.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Predictions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Size-density scaling with exponent -1.
\end{itemize}

We start from the cavity solution for the equilibrium biomass density $b_0$
\begin{equation}
    b^* = \left(\frac{\mu S \langle b^* \rangle + \sigma \sqrt{S\langle (b^*)^2\rangle} \eta}
    {r \ b_0^{1-k}}\right)^{1/(k-1)} \, ,
\end{equation}
where we consider $r$ uniform and different for each community type as in the model
connection with data on production.
Each community is characterized by an average mass $m$, and, given that we consider
$\mu S \propto r$ (it varies in a range of two order of magnitude above and below $r$),
it cancels out with $r$ leaving no mass dependence.
Therefore the average numerical densities $\langle n^*\rangle$ 
of different community types will
be inversely proportional to their mass $m$ with a spread on the $y$ axes
due to different $(\mu, \sigma)$
\begin{equation}
    \langle n^*\rangle \sim m^{-1} \, .
\end{equation}
In Fig.~\ref{fig: SM size-density scaling} we report the average numerical density vs. 
body mass for the different community types using the same 
parameters from Fig.~\ref{fig: SM production}.
